# Employee Shift Manager
##### - a platform designed to streamline and enhance the process of managing work schedules for both employers and employees.

The *Employee Shift Scheduler* is a platform where on one side the employers can easily set up and publish weekly work schedules with their team, considering things like employee availability.
On the other side, employees get a clear view of when they're scheduled to work each week, including the hours and expected pay. They also get to set their availability for each week and switch shifts with other employees in case they are no longer able to make it to work.

This project is of interest to me because it tackles a common problem in workplaces â€“ the hassle of managing schedules. By making it easy for employers to organize and employees to access their schedules, it promises to improve communication, reduce conflicts, and create a more positive work environment.
